#3dNav

##3d navigator for CAD design

This is a work in process project for a 3d design navigator.

The idea is use a MPU6050 in combination with an Arduino Micro to send relative movements to your 3d CAD software of choice.

I shall configure it to be use on FreeCAD since it is the software I use the most and it will work with many CAD design softwares since they share the same keyboard/mouse combination for panning and orbiting, but you could change the code to suit your needs.

I have no previous experience coding so, if you can improve the code in any way feel free to let me know.

Material list:

- Arduino Micro
- MPU6050 Module
- Push botton
- Rubber bands
- USB to USB-Mini cable 
- PLA filament

You will need to 3d print some parts, but if you do not own a 3d printer maybe there is a maker space near you.
